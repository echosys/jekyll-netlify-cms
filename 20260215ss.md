Running a standard Shadowsocks server on Cloudflare is tricky because Cloudflare's free tier is primarily a proxy for web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS), whereas Shadowsocks typically requires a raw TCP or UDP port.

Here is the breakdown of how you can (and cannot) do it with Cloudflare Free Tier:

1. Cloudflare Workers (The WebSocket Workaround)
Cloudflare Workers do not support inbound TCP ports yet (it's "Coming Soon"). However, you can run Shadowsocks on Workers by "wrapping" the traffic in WebSockets.

How it works: You deploy a Worker script that listens for WebSocket connections.
Requirements: You must use a Shadowsocks client that supports the v2ray-plugin or similar WebSocket transport.
Pros: Entirely free, serverless, and hides your IP behind Cloudflare.
Cons: Limited CPU time (10ms on free tier), which might slow down high-speed traffic, and technically follows a "grey area" in Cloudflare's Terms of Service (Section 2.8 regarding non-HTML content).
2. Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared)
If you have a server at home or a small VPS, you can use Cloudflare Tunnel to expose it without opening ports on your router.

The Problem: Cloudflare's free tier only supports HTTP/HTTPS and WebSockets for public traffic.
The Catch: To run raw TCP (like Shadowsocks) over a Tunnel for free, the client also has to run cloudflared (using the cloudflared access tcp command). This makes it hard to use with standard mobile Shadowsocks apps.
3. Cloudflare Spectrum (The "Standard" Way)
Spectrum is the product that actually allows raw TCP/UDP proxying through Cloudflare.

Is it free?: Generally no. On the Free/Pro/Business plans, Spectrum only supports a few specific protocols (like SSH on port 22 or Minecraft). General TCP/UDP proxying on arbitrary ports is usually reserved for Enterprise customers.
Better Alternatives for a Free Shadowsocks Server
If you need a real TCP port for free, Cloudflare might not be the right tool. Most people use these instead:

Oracle Cloud Free Tier: This is the best option. You get two "Always Free" VM instances with a fixed IP and completely open ports. It is far more powerful than any serverless workaround.
Google Cloud Free Tier: Offers an e2-micro instance for free (mostly in US regions). It has 1GB RAM and allows you to open any port you need.
Summary: If you are determined to stay on Cloudflare, look into "Shadowsocks over Cloudflare Workers" (GitHub is full of these templates). Just be aware you'll need a client that supports WebSocket tunneling.
