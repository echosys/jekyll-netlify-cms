You've hit the nail on the head. Most "free" clouds have a hidden "Tax" in the form of IPv4 or Traffic costs that make them expensive for a proxy server.

Here is the direct comparison between Oracle and GCP for your specific use case:

1. Oracle Cloud (The "Unicorn" Tier)
Oracle is currently the only major provider that gives away enough bandwidth for a real VPN/Shadowsocks server.

Public IPv4: $0.00 (Free). They include 1 Public IPv4 address for your "Always Free" instances.
Traffic/Bandwidth: $0.00 (Free) for the first 10 TB (Terabytes) per month. This is an insane amount of data for a free tier.
The Catch: Oracle is notoriously hard to sign up for. They are very strict with credit card verification and often run out of "Free" capacity in popular regions (like US-East or London).
2. Google Cloud Platform (The "Trap" Tier)
Building a Shadowsocks server on GCP is usually a mistake because of the traffic limits.

Public IPv4: Free ONLY while in use. If you turn the VM off but keep the IP, they charge you (~$7.20/month). If the VM is running and you stay under 750 hours/month, the IP is free.
Traffic/Bandwidth: Only 1 GB (Gigabyte) free per month.
Once you pass 1GB, you start paying roughly $0.08 to $0.12 per GB (depending on the destination).
If you use 100GB of traffic (typical for a proxy), you'll get a surprise bill for $10–$12.
Cost Check: Your $2/GB estimate is a bit high for standard traffic, but because the free limit is so tiny (1GB), practically all your usage will be paid usage.
Comparison Table for Shadowsocks
Feature	Oracle Cloud (Free)	GCP (Free Tier)
VM Power	Up to 24GB RAM (ARM)	~0.6 GB RAM (e2-micro)
IPv4 Cost	$0	$0 (In-use)
Free Traffic	10,000 GB	1 GB
Shadowsocks?	Perfect	Too Expensive
Recommendations:
Check Oracle Cloud first. If you can get past the sign-up and find an "Always Free" instance available in your region, it is the best free server on the internet.
Avoid GCP/AWS/Azure for Shadowsocks. All three have very stingy bandwidth limits (GCP is 1GB, AWS/Azure are ~100GB) that will eventually cost you money.
Alternative: RackNerd or CloudCone. If you can't get Oracle and don't want to use the Cloudflare Workers "hack," you can often buy a "Black Friday" VPS for about $10–$15 per YEAR that includes 1TB+ of bandwidth. It's not free, but it's "safe" from surprise bills.
