<p>Hi! <br><br>My name is Arman. I am a Software Consultant, .NET Full-stack Dev, Solution Architect, Team Lead and a blogger with 15+ years of experience, currently working as a software consultant in Australia. <br><br>In this blog, I share my experiences and learnings on dotnet coding, software engineering, AI and Technology. <br><br>My tech stack is mainly in .NET, C#, Azure and other Microsoft technologies. However, I have worked with a myriad of various programming languages, Databases, programming methodologies and recently different cloud services. <br><br>Here, I would like to write my thoughts about coding, software and its industry, technology in a succinct way. I like to-the-point posts so that the content can be skimmed and absorbed quickly. <br><br></p>
