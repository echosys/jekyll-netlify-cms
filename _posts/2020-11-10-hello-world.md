My name is Arman and here is my new blog. I would like to write my thoughts about programming, software and its industry, technology in a succinct and tl;dr way. I like to-the-point posts in a way that the content can be skimmed and absorbed quickly.

My posts are live documents and I update them with the comments/reviews I get and new information I learn.

What I write here mostly applies on .NET world (especially C#) and Scrum teams.
