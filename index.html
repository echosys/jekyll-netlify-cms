    Arman Notes is a tech blog on everything related to coding, software engineering, AI, and the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
</p>
<p>
    I have been coding for 15+ years and here I share my real-world experiences and practical insights, tutorials, case studies, and thought pieces
    that not only demystify the complexities of AI algorithms but also offer actionable tips for effective software
    development.
